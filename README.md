# Character Animation HW2

# Plan of attack!
- Collect distance of each foot traveled each frame in seperate arrays
- Take first derivative of both arrays to get foot velocities
- Search each array for when velocity hits zero, these are the steps
- Use the step information to create ratios for each of the character's step rate
- Sync the times
